# farmer-simulaor
This is a simple little program I made to experiment with python and to have a little fun.

Instructions:
1) Run the "Game.py" with python3

When you must type commands you can either have caps lock on or off. The program will convert the input to uppercase automatically. I recommend going to the shop at the beginning as a first step.

List of Commands:
 **COMMANDS** - shows this command list
 **QUIT**     - will exit the game                           
 **DISPLAY**  - displays your farm and energy                
 **SHOP**     - buy and sell goods at the shop               
 **TILL**     - till on a given plot                         
 **WATER**    - water on a given plot
