This is a simple little program I made to experiment with python and to have a little fun.

Instructions:
1) Run the "Game.py" with python3

When you must type commands you can either have caps lock on or off. The program will convert the input to uppercase automatically. I recommend going to the shop at the beginning as a first step.
